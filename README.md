## Mission Statement

The *Lemona* project's objectives are to provide:
  * a complete proposal for a secured and reliable open architecture;
  * and its full-featured implementation.

The goals of the *Lemona* software are:
  * to monitor and to trace system activity at the kernel and user level;
  * to report and to store archives of this activity on remote and/or local repositories;
  * to provide understandable information for the recovery and forensics analysis of compromised systems.


## Master of IT at Macquarie University

*Lemona* was started by Laurent Malvert and Kenfe-Mickael Laventure, students at the Macquarie University in 2008, as part of the completion requirements for their Master of Information Technology (Software Engineering) program, and more specifically for research spanning the ITEC851, ITEC854, ITEC855, ITEC856 units (which may now be defunct,  superseded, or different than what they used to be).

### Licenses

The original *Lemona* project contains patches and modules developed for the Linux Kernel. Therefore, it is currently released under the terms of the _General Public License (version 2)_.

However, it is planned to have *Lemona*'s other modules released under the terms of the more permissive _MIT/X11 License_ in the future, only the kernel patches remaining published under the _GPLv2_.
