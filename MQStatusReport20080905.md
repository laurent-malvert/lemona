## Project Management Updates ##

### Project Schedule ###

We are still following the original project schedule,
as presented in the original Gantt chart (see the Project
Ouline document). So far, we seem to be right on time.

### Task Distribution ###

We have not modified the task distribution and they are
still separated as presented in the table above (see the
Status Notes section of the present document).


## Problems Encountered ##

Though we found extensive documentation covering the
fields of information systems surveillance when looking
for references, we were a little surprised by the sparse
resources we found implementing actual working forensics
solutions. We have however managed to find several related
projects which, although not as complete or having the
same goal of lemona, have given us some ideas of what to
do and how, and what misconceptions might lead to
pitfalls.

In addition, considering the growing attention and interest
from the research community for this specific topic, we
expect to see more papers published in close relationship
with one or more components of a surveillance system.
