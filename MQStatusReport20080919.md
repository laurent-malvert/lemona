## Project Management Updates ##

### Project Schedule ###

We are still following the original project schedule,
as presented in the original Gantt chart (see the Project
Ouline document). So far, we seem to be right on time.

### Task Distribution ###

We have not modified the task distribution and they are
still separated as presented in the table above (see the
Status Notes section of the present document).


## Peer Presentation ##

The First Peer Presentation deliverable has been produced for
Friday 19th, to be presented during the Ethics Workshop on Week 7.
It briefly introduces computer security and forensics as the
background theme of the project, and outlines the Lemona architecture
and workflow to address issues exposed by related projects.
