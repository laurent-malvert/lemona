## MQ and Lemona ##

### How is Lemona related/affiliated to MQ ? ###

Lemona has been started in 2008 by two international students of the
{EPITECH.} European Institute of Technology, while pursuing a Master of
Information Technology course program at the Macquarie University of
Sydney.

This project was developed as a joint assignment for [ITEC810](http://www.comp.mq.edu.au/units/itec810/) and
[ITEC856](http://www.comp.mq.edu.au/units/itec856/) units, with different
parts of the project relating to each unit.

Therefore, Lemona is not a project officially endorsed by the Macquarie
University, though it is for the moment being developed by Macquarie
students. Future arrangements might be done for the project to be still
open for future students to contribute as part of their project.

### Is Lemona developed by MQ ? ###

Lemona is, as of 2008, developed by Macquarie students as a requirement
for some of their Information Technology / Software Engineering course.

It is not developed by MQ staff (or not officially), and is the sole
responsibility of the 2 founders of the project as of today.

### Is MQ supporting Lemona ? ###

Lemona does not receive, as of 2008, any support from the Macquarie
University, except for the use computer resources of the ICS Division
on the campus.

### Can I work on Lemona for one of my units at MQ ? ###

We are still working on Lemona as our university project, but we are
already thinking it could be interesting for future students to take
part to this collaborative effort and get involved with Lemona's
research and development.

Further information will be posted when the current developers complete
their course program and (hopefully) receive their post-graduate degree.

### Can I base my research project on Lemona ? ###

You are entirely free to base your own research project, or any project
for that matter, on Lemona and its entities.

Be aware however that some of Lemona's software components are released
under the terms of the General Public License v2. This means you **have**
to open source your own research project if you reuse these software
components.

If you are a student, feel free to contribute to Lemona as a part of
your research project, or to start/fork another project and reuse
anything you want. Please just let us know what you're doing, and give
us accreditations accordingly, while respecting the terms of our
distribution license.
