Over the last decades, companies and individuals have undergone a
shift from legacy information processing systems to computerized
information systems. This trend largely impacts the usage and access
policies of valuable assets. Unfortunately, the modern enterprise and
private models of information processing are as exposed as their
ancestors, and we recognize a matching raise of cyber-robbery and
malevolent misuse.

Forensic science, or forensics, aims to answer questions asked by the
legal system to establish the liability of individuals in relation to
criminal acts. It naturally encompasses what we call computer
forensics, which is a specific branch pertaining to legal evidence
being looked for and examined in digital systems.

The goal of computer forensics is to determine the course of actions
who led to the state of a digital artifact. Such an artifact can be
either a storage media or a static or mobile piece of electronic
information (an electronic document or a network packets).

Examples of typical case studies and illegal activities are diverse [13 ](.md):

  * network intrusions,
  * corruption of private or corporate data,
  * stealing of private or corporate data,
  * or the publication and storage of illegal content.

The role of the forensics expert, in a legal context, is to provide [2 ](.md):

  * the technical information bound to the criminal act,
  * the skills and technological background to understand its surroundings,
  * evidence of the absence or presence of the crime.

Considering this setting, it means computer forensics analysis has to
be led following a very strict, professional and documented
protocol. In effect, every action of the forensics team has to be
recorded and should prove the validity of its method and its results.
