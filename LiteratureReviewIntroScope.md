This document presents the result of the research conducted in the
development of the Lemona project.

The Lemona project aims at providing a secure, complete and efficient
mean of monitoring a Linux-based system. As such, related work
presented here are based mostly on Linux-based (and sometimes on
UNIX-based) system, although, some of the conceptual ideas would be
applicable to other Operating Systems. Thus, references made to the
Kernel or System should be interpreted as being Linux when not
otherwise specified.
