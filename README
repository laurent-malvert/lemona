Supported Kernel
================================================

Currently, Lemona has only be tested against the Linux 2.6.26.3
vanilla sources. Futhermore, Lemona is only available for the x86
architecture.

================================================
How-To Build Using Full Patch
================================================

Building Lemona as a kernel module is quite simple:

  - Download the patch corresponding to your kernel:
     wget http://lemona.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/patchs/patch-X.X.XX.X \
     -O lemona.patch-X.X.XX.X

  - Apply the patch to your kernel
     cd $(PATH_TO_KERNEL_SRC)
     patch -p1 < lemona_patch-X.X.XX.X

  - Select the build mode for lemona in your kernel .config by using
    make menuconfig for instance
     make menuconfig
       Lemona ->
         Enable Lemona

  - Build & install your new kernel

================================================
How-To Build Using Partial Patch (Developers)
================================================

  - Checkout the lemona sources
     svn co http://lemona.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ lemona-read-only

  - Update your kernel sources to include lemona
     cd $(PATH_TO_KERNEL_SRC)
     patch -p1 < $(PATH_TO_LEMONA_SRC)/patchs/patch-X.X.XX.X.partial
     ln -s $(PATH_TO_LEMONA_SRC) lemona

  - Select the build mode for lemona in your kernel .config by using
    make menuconfig for instance
     make menuconfig
       Lemona ->
         Enable Lemona

  - Build & install your new kernel

================================================
Loading Lemona (if build as a Module)
================================================

To load Lemona simply use the following command:
  insmod ./lemona.ko
You should see a line like the following in your logs (use dmesg to see it):
  -==Lemona==- Initialization for kernel tree 2.6.26.3...
  -==Lemona==- Done.

================================================
Unloading Lemona (if build as a Module)
================================================

To unload Lemona simply use the following command:
  rmmod lemona
The following line should appear in your logs (use dmesg to see it)
  -==Lemona==- Uninitializing...
  -==Lemona==- Done.

================================================
How-To Generate Kernel Patch (Developers)
================================================

To generate a new lemona patch, you will need the following:
  - a Linux Kernel vanilla untouched (i.e. you just extracted it and
    didn't do ANYTHING else. No make menuconfig, no compilation, NOTHING).
    We'll call it linux.vanilla.

  - The same Kernel modified to support Lemona but without any object,
    backup, vn or other uneeded files.
    We'll call it linux.lemona

  - These 2 folders should be directly accessible from a common one
    (use symbolic links if necessary)

Now, generating the patch is quite easy:
  - Go to the directory where you can directly access both kernel sources

  - Execute the following command (where X.X.XX.X is the kernel version)
     diff -uNr linux.vanilla linux.lemona > patch-X.X.XX.X

  - NOTE: Be sure NOT to have any trailing directory before either
    linux.vanilla or linux.lemona or the standard patching method (-p1
    option to patch) won't work

  - Check your patch to ensure that it didn't include any unwanted
    change (maybe you forgot to delete a backup file?)
